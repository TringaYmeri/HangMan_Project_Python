Hangman Project

The provided code creates a GUI-based Hangman game using Tkinter. Players choose a difficulty level and word category, then guess letters or the full word within a set number of attempts (depending on the level chosen). Players win by guessing the word correctly or lose if they run out of attempts. After the game, they can play again or quit.
